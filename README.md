# Google Udacity Portfolio
## Adriana Å afran < FEND />

### About page:
This webpage is my own portfolio where I will continue uploading my projects which I am currently doing 
while studying on <a href="https://eu.udacity.com/">Udacity</a> an Front-End Web Dev nanodegree program.

### Files:
1. index.html
2. /css
3. /img
4. /js
5. /card _(first project included in webpage)_
6. /mockup _(project from challenge phrase, **not included in webpage** for now)_
7. /pixelart _(project from challenge phrase, **not included in webpage** for now)_

### Page:
You are currently in a file repository but I made it as **"gh-pages" branch** so you can see my page on this <a href="https://adr1ana.github.io/GoogleUdacity/">link</a> too.

### Additional info:
I created 8 cards but only 2 projects are linked. I plan to update all how my course is going. 
<br>I will create maybe few more cards to add my extra work (as Mockup/ Pixel Art), not just projects.
<br>All icons are created by me, same as web-drawing.svg picture. 
<br>Other pictures are edited by me, found on google search.
